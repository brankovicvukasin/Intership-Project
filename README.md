# Web Scraping Application for Technology Trend Analysis

## Overview

During my internship at Vega It Nis, I developed a full-stack web application for web scraping to analyze client requests and technology trends. The application was designed to scrape data from a local Kanban board web app, which contained all client requests, as well as other external websites for technology-related keywords.

## Features

- **Data Scraping:** Extract client requests from a local Kanban board web app and external websites for technology keywords.
- **Data Visualization:** Display the scraped data through various charts, including linear regression and standard deviation analysis, to identify the most in-demand technologies.
- **Trend Analysis:** Track and analyze technology trends to help the company forecast the number of developers needed.
- **Comprehensive Insights:** Provide actionable insights on technology trends and demands.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd web-scraping-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys).

5. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

- Scrape data from the local Kanban board web app and external websites.
- View various charts displaying the most in-demand technologies based on scraped data.
- Analyze technology trends to assist in workforce planning and resource allocation.
