# Web Scraping Application for Technology Trend Analysis

## Overview

During my internship at Vega It Nis, I developed a full-stack web application for web scraping to analyze client requests and technology trends. The application was designed to scrape data from a local Kanban board web app, which contained all client requests, as well as other external websites for technology-related keywords.
